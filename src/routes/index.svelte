    <h1>Zack Clark</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my portfolio. It's where I show off my hobby projects, and <s>trick</s> convince people that I should be hired.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a former Air Force Officer and current Full Stack Software Engineer building PWAs and leading dev teams since 2018.

    <p>
        My favorite environment is one where strong opinions are loosely held and radical honesty is the status quo.
